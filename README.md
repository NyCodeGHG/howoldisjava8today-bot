# How Old is Java 8 Today?

This is my rewrite of my originally Kotlin based Twitter bot from
[here](https://github.com/i-voted-for-biden2/howoldisjava8.today/tree/main/twitter-bot).

It tweets every day on 10 AM UTC how old java 8 is, to remind people to upgrade
to more up-to-date java version.

You can follow the bot [here](https://twitter.com/HowOldIsJava8) on Twitter.
