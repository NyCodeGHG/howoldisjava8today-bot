# How Old is Java 8 Today?

> This is my rewrite of my originally Kotlin based Twitter bot from
> [here](https://github.com/i-voted-for-biden2/howoldisjava8.today/tree/main/twitter-bot).

It tweets (and toots) every day on 10 AM UTC how old java 8 is, to remind people to upgrade
to more up-to-date java version.

- You can follow the bot [here](https://twitter.com/HowOldIsJava8) on Twitter.
- It's also available [here](https://botsin.space/@HowOldIsJava8) in the Fediverse on the [botsin.space](https://botsin.space) [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) Instance.
